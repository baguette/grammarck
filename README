grammarck:  check a context free grammar for particular properties

The idea of grammarck is to take a yacc-style grammar and to check
it for various properties.

As an example, suppose you want to check if a particular grammar is
LL(1).  grammarck ought to be able to do that (but not yet, this
project is a work in progress).
