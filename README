grammarck:  check a context free grammar for particular properties

The idea of grammarck is to take a yacc-style grammar and to check
it for various properties.

As an example, suppose you want to check if a particular grammar is
LL(1).  grammarck ought to be able to do that.

To build you need OCaml 4.01 or newer.  There are two ways to build:

1) Using make:  simply navigate to the grammarck directory and run make
2) Using ocamlbuild:  navigate to the src directory and run
   ocamlbuild main.native

The resulting executable will be src/main.native

There are some sample grammars in the test directory.
